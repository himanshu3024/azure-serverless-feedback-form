# Azure Serverless Feedback Form

A simple web feedback form built using Azure Static Web Apps and Azure Functions.

## Features
- Frontend: HTML + JavaScript
- Backend: Azure Function to handle form submissions
- Hosted using Azure Static Web Apps
- CI/CD with GitHub Actions

## Folder Structure
- `/frontend` → Web form (HTML + JS)
- `/api` → Azure Function to process form data

## How It Works
When a user submits the form, the data is sent to an Azure Function endpoint, which processes the input in real-time.

## Credits
Built as a personal project to practice serverless deployment on Microsoft Azure.
